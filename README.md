# 👋 Hi, I'm Sahar 🧙‍♂️ 

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a coding sorcerer with a penchant for turning coffee into code and chaos into solutions. By day, I masquerade as a Data Science Engineer, but truth be told, I'm just a curious explorer lost in the binary wilderness.

## 💡 What I Do
As a Data Science Engineer, I decode insights from complex datasets, architect robust pipelines, and infuse Java elegance into my code. PowerBI and SSIS are my trusted companions in this digital journey.

## 🌌 Current Mission
Exploring new galaxies of data, solving puzzles with code, and attempting to understand the mysteries of the universe, one bug at a time.


Join me on this tech adventure, where data speaks, Java guides, and every commit tells a story! 🌟🔧
